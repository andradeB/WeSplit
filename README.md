# 100 day os SwiftUI !

Welcome to the 100 Days of SwiftUI! This is a free collection of videos, tutorials, tests designed to learn SwiftUI.

# Project

In this project we’re going to be building a check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant – you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.
